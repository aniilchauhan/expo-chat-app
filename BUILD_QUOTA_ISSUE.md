# ⚠️ BUILD QUOTA ISSUE IDENTIFIED

## 🔍 Problem Found

Your Expo build attempts have been failing because you've **exhausted your Android build quota** for this billing period.

### Current Usage (Nov 1 - Dec 1, 2025):
- ✅ **Android builds**: 15 out of 15 used (100%)
- ✅ **iOS builds**: 0 out of 15 used (0%)
- ✅ **Total builds**: 15 out of 30 used

**You have NO remaining Android builds** for this month.

## 💡 Your Options

### Option 1: Wait for Quota Reset (FREE)
**Next reset**: December 1, 2025
- Your build quota will reset to 15 Android + 15 iOS builds
- **Days to wait**: ~1 day
- **Cost**: $0

### Option 2: Upgrade to Paid Plan (IMMEDIATE)
Upgrade your Expo account to get more builds:

**Production Plan** - $29/month
- **Unlimited builds**
- Priority build queue
- Faster build times
- Additional features

**To upgrade:**
1. Go to: https://expo.dev/accounts/anilchauhan.29.5/settings/billing
2. Click "Upgrade" or "Change Plan"
3. Select "Production" plan
4. Complete payment
5. Start building immediately!

### Option 3: Use Development Build (WORKAROUND)
If you have iOS build quota remaining, you could:
1. Build for iOS instead (if you have a Mac for testing)
2. Use Expo Go for development/testing
3. Wait for Android quota reset

### Option 4: Create New Expo Account (NOT RECOMMENDED)
- Create a new Expo account
- Get fresh 30 builds/month
- **Downside**: Lose project history, need to reconfigure

## 📊 Build History

Based on your usage, you've created 15 Android builds this month. These were likely from your previous build attempts in earlier conversations.

## 🎯 Recommended Action

**If you need the build NOW:**
→ Upgrade to Production plan ($29/month)
→ Get unlimited builds immediately

**If you can wait ~1 day:**
→ Wait until December 1, 2025
→ Your quota resets automatically
→ Build for free
